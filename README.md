# Car Depreciation Cost vs Car Lease Cost

In this project I set out to answer the question, if you're in the market for a new car should you buy a 3 year lease or buy the car and resell it 3 years later?

If depreciation cost was greater than the cost of a 3-year lease, I would conclude you should buy the lease.  Otherwise buying the car and reselling it is cheaper.  

## Code

In this directory there is my code to obtain my models in predicting car depreciation cost. I modeled two specific trims of the Acura TLX, the standard package and technology package. 

## Data

My data was webscraped from online car marketplaces.  I scraped data on two specific trims and modeled them seperately.
